# Hidden Markov Model for Hard Disk Drive Failure Detection

Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) serve as primary non-volatile storage in computers, making it crucial in various devices, including servers and laptops, with applications including data storage, file organization, data backup, and virtual memory use. Since HDDs play a critical role in the efficiency of many large-scale commercial systems, failure detection using efficient models becomes an essential task.
